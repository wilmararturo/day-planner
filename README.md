# Day Planner

A simple day planner that allows the user to save events in one hour increments for the work day (8:00AM - 6:00PM).


## Directions

*  Navigate to [Work Day Scheduler](https://wilmararturo.github.io/day-planner/)
*  For each hour of the day, events can be entered in the text area and saved by clicking the blue save button on the right.
*  The current hour will be red.  Past and future hours will be grey and green respectively.
*  Events will persist reloads throughout the day.
